**Excel & Python Automation | Data Tools | Trading Bots | Dashboards**

At **Data Solutions Lab**, I build intelligent automation tools and data-driven solutions that empower professionals, analysts, and traders to work smarter.  
From **Excel VBA macros** that streamline daily workflows to **Python automation scripts** that integrate and process large datasets — every project here is designed to save time, reduce manual errors, and turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.

💡 The lab also explores the intersection of **AI and financial markets**, developing advanced **algorithmic trading bots** powered by Python and machine learning. These tools focus on:
- Real-time data fetching from multiple APIs (crypto, forex, and equities)
- Automated strategy execution and risk control
- Statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, and reinforcement learning models
- Backtesting, optimization, and performance reporting

Whether you're an **analyst**, **freelancer**, or **developer**, you’ll find open-source resources here that combine:

📊 Excel VBA Automation • 🤖 Python Scripting • 📈 Algorithmic Trading • 📤 Data Reporting
